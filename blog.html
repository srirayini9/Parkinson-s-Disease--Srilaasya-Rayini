                 <p style = "color: black">Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that afffects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms that can significantly impact daily life. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of Parkinson's Disease, its symptoms, treatment options, and ongoing research.</p>

            <h2 style = "color: #C98C31">What is Parkinson's Disease?</h2>
                <p style = "color:black">Parkinson's Disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder that primarily afffects movement. It results from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. This loss leads to the hallmark symptoms of the disease, which include tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement). For a detailed overview, visit the Parkinson's Foundation.</p>
            <h2 style ="color:#C98C31">Symptoms and Diagnosis</h2>
                <p style = "color: black">Common Symptoms
                Parkinson's Disease manifests through a variety of symptoms, which can be broadly categorized into motor and non-motor symptoms.
                Motor Symptoms: Tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability.
                Non-Motor Symptoms: Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment.</p>
            <h2 style = "color:#C98C31">Treatment Options</h2>
                <p style = "color: black">While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease, several treatment options can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
                Medications
                Levodopa/Carbidopa: The most commonly prescribed medication that helps replenish dopamine levels.
                Dopamine Agonists: These mimic the efffects of dopamine in the brain.
                Surgical Options
                Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): A surgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes in the brain to reduce symptoms.</p>
